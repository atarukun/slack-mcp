## MCP Implementation Best Practices

### Key MCP Patterns to Follow
- **Use FastMCP Framework**: Leverages Python type hints and docstrings for automatic tool registration
- **STDIO Transport**: Primary transport method for MCP servers (required for Claude Desktop)
- **Async Functions**: All tools should be async for proper MCP performance
- **Type Hints**: Essential for automatic parameter schema generation
- **String Returns**: Tools should return formatted strings, not JSON objects
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with informative error messages

### Server Configuration Requirements
- **Absolute Paths**: Claude Desktop requires absolute paths in configuration
- **uv Package Manager**: Recommended Python package manager for MCP projects
- **Environment Variables**: Secure token storage using `.env` files
- **Proper Logging**: Use stderr for logs, stdout for MCP protocol communication

### Linux Compatibility Notes
- Claude Desktop not available on Linux - test with alternative MCP clients
- Build custom MCP client for testing if needed
- Ensure server works with programmatic MCP connections
- Validate STDIO transport compatibility across platforms

## Notes

- This roadmap follows official MCP development guidelines from modelcontextprotocol.io
- Updated to use FastMCP framework for rapid development
- Emphasizes STDIO transport for maximum compatibility
- Timeline may vary based on complexity of specific features
- Security and testing should be continuous throughout development
- Regular feedback and iteration cycles are recommended
