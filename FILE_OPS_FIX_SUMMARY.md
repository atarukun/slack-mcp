# File Operations Tools Fix Summary

## Issue #30: File Operations Tools Failing

### Fixed Tools:

1. **`list_files`** - ADDED (was missing)
   - Implements pagination support
   - Filters by channel, user, and file types
   - Returns formatted list with file details including size, upload time, and sharing info
   - Properly handles empty results

2. **`get_file_content`** - ADDED (was missing)
   - Downloads and displays content of text-based files
   - Validates file type (supports text, code, config files)
   - Enforces size limits (default 10MB)
   - Uses proper authentication headers for download
   - Truncates very large files (>50k chars) with notice

3. **`share_file`** - FIXED
   - Now properly creates a public URL using `files.sharedPublicURL` API
   - Posts messages with the public file link to specified channels
   - Supports sharing to multiple channels in one operation
   - Includes optional comment when sharing

### Implementation Details:

- All tools use async operations with proper rate limiting
- Error handling includes specific error messages for different failure scenarios
- Tools return formatted text output (not JSON) as per MCP requirements
- Uses the standardized utilities from the refactored codebase

### Testing:

Created `test_file_ops_fix.py` to validate:
- File upload (prerequisite)
- List files functionality
- Get file info (already working)
- Download file content
- Share file with public URL
- File deletion cleanup

The fixes ensure all Phase 7 file operations work correctly as specified in the ROADMAP.
